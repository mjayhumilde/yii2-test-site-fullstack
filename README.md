# My Portfolio: A Project-Based Learning Experience (Yii2 Advanced Template)

This is a personal portfolio website created as a side project to learn **Yii2 PHP framework**. The project is specifically designed to provide hands-on experience with the core technologies used at my internship:

- **Yii2 Framework:** Understanding the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and its core components.
- **SQL Database:** Gaining practical experience with database design, data storage, and interaction.
- **Gii Code Generator:** Utilizing Yii2's powerful code generator to rapidly build and manage models, views, and controllers, which accelerates development and reinforces best practices.

By building this project, I am focusing on a practical application of these technologies to create a functional, modern website with a separation of concerns for the frontend and a secure backend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Features and Database Schema

The project includes a full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Update, Delete) implementation for managing a portfolio. The database schema, visible in phpMyAdmin, consists of the following key tables:

- **`file`**: Manages uploaded files.
- **`migration`**: Tracks database changes.
- **`project`**: Stores portfolio project details.
- **`project_image`**: Stores images associated with projects.
- **`testimonial`**: Manages testimonials or endorsements.
- **`user`**: Handles user authentication and management for the backend.

The **`user`** table is used for securing the admin panel where the other tables' data can be managed.
